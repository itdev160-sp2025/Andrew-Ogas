            My Introduction To 3D Printing
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 2003, while I was in highschool, a group of students were looking for suggestions for molecules to have modelled.
            It seemed strange that they'd need a special group for making ball and stick models of different molecules. 
            What they told me was they were going to be made out of a powder, bound together with glue and ink in a process that would form a model layer by layer.
            This was my first Introduction to a process known as <i>rapid prototyping</i>, more commonly referred to now as <i>3D Printing.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            After that moment, I had wanted to get involved with 3D printing. Many years later, I was able to get my own.
            The amazing power of being able to make 3D models on my computer and have them automatically fabricated out of a variety of plastics now sits on my desk.
            I've printed toys and tools, items that are purely aesthetic and items that are purely functional. What more, I now have three different printers and would like to have more.
            It's more than just a toy, it's a tool to adapt the world function how I want it to.

            As mentioned, I have three 3D printers right now of varying capacity.

                        This was my first 3D printer, and it has served me well. Despite lacking many modern features, it still works reliably.
                        Perhaps it's simplicity had been the key to it's longevity. I've printed <abbr title="polylactic acid">PLA</abbr>, 
                        <abbr title="polyethylene terephthalate glycol">PETG</abbr>, <abbr title="acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ">ABS</abbr>, 
                        <abbr title="acrylonitrile styrene acrylate ">ASA</abbr>, Nylon, and even <abbr title="polycarbonate">PC</abbr>(to mixed success).
                        I probably won't do much upgrading, since I have better options now, but I do still use it.

                        This was my first resin 3D printer and has been quite the learning experience. It's both better and worse than filament printing. 
                        The uncured resin is toxic and gets everywhere. The software is not as straightforward as there are no common print file standards. 
                        It has in general just been a lot more trouble, despite being more simple in principle. 
                        All that being said, there is no comparison to the detail it can produce. Prints are incredibly intricate. 
                        It doesn't matter the size of the print in the X or Y dimension, only the Z dimension determines the time it will take. 
                        This makes it print remarkably fast for the size of prints it makes compared to a filament printer. 
                        I don't use it as much as I'd like, but a more convenient setup would help.

                        After using the original Todd Howard for years, I had wanted a larger and more capable printer. 
                        After debating building a printer from scratch, I decided to get the Ender 5 Plus and upgrade it. 
                        With a build volume over a foot cubed, it can make very large items. 
                        The increased temperatures and enclosure have allowed me to print different materials. 
                        When I upgrade it further, it should be extremely reliable, serviceable, and indispensable.
