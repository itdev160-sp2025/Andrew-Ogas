                    <h3>Classic Turboencabulation</h3>
                    <p>The Turboencabulator once seemed a far off dream. While engineers had wanted to integrate inverse reactive 
                        current and gram carcinized flux impulse, it wasn't until the original Turboencabulator that it became a reality.
                         Deployed in novertrunnions around the world, many turboencabulators are reaching their end of life. 
                         If a machine has reached 100,000 annular pulse rotations, inspect the lunar waneshaft. 
                         If it shows signs of dichromonic finching, strongly consider a pre-emptive replacement of your 
                         turboencabulator unit.</p>
                    <h3>Drop In Replacement Part</h3>
                    <p>This classic unit will serve to replace all GE turboencabulator units, model year 1962-1978. 
                        If you are replacing an encabulator based on this model, be sure to check the manufacturers information for
                        appropriateness of substitution.

                    <p>If you're looking for a replacement turboencabulator unit for an original 1962 GE HBK-8359, this is the one. 
                        I was amazed they were still making these. Works just like the original when it was new.

                        <p>This unit saved me a lot of time. I had been planning on switching our hemi-spec unit with a more modern
                            solid state encabulator, but when I started getting into the weeds of it, it just seemed easier to go 
                            with this classic unit. Phase deterrence and dolop-loaded input channel conversion was not something I was 
                            interested in learning. The old unit lasted the fifty years it was in service, so the cost should more than 
                            be covered by the lifespan of this unit.
                        </p>
                        <p>One thing to be aware of, if you haven't seen pervitin pulses, syncopated or semi-phased, do your research. 
                            It's a lot more intense than you might expect, but the marsal-vanes can take it. This isn't solid state 
                            and was built for this, but know what to look out for for biereatic shock. Make sure to get the flux alignment right 
                            to prevent premature finching.
